# Bitcoins
DOS Project 1
The goal of this first project is to use F# and the actor model to build a Simple Bitcoin model usin SHA-256, and create multiple actors to mine the coins using AKKA.net.

1. Generating random strings (relatively easier, so this subproblem was assigned less workers)
2. Mining coins (this subproblem was assigned more workers)
